function epochdata = max2epochs(data, fs, epoch)
% MAX2EPOCHS Aggregates maximal values per second across epochs
%
% Description:
%   The function converts a time series to epochs of length epoch. It will
%   pick the peak values per second and sums these values over the epoch
%   This is an pre-processing step that is performed online on the
%   CamNtech/Respironics AWD/AWL devices
%
% Arguments:
%   data - input data timeseries
%   fs - sampling frequency of the data
%   epoch - required epoch length in seconds
%
% Results:
%   epochdata - series of epochs
%
